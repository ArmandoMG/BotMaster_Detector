# BotMaster_Detector
Repo for my C++ project to detect bot masters from a bot attack given a certain database

### Explanation of the problem
How would you Detect cybernetic bot attacks? 
One way to detect this type of situation is through the collection of all relevant information that allows us to perform optimized searches for the timely detection of malicious access through robot networks.

We are looking forwar to answer the next questions:

What data structures can we use to store this type of information?

What data structure will serve to make a search for information more efficient?

How to know if an access is malicious?

How to distinguish "real" accesses from those that are not?

How can we create groups of information that characterize these accesses?

### Instructions
search_main.cpp: This cpp file allows to search very efficiently any IP address in the dataset and obtain the information from this IP 
find_attacks.cpp: This cpp file finds (in a very efficient way) the IP address of the botmaster or the attacker

### Results
With this program we succesfully discovered the botmaster using efficient data structures and algorithms. Our results are shown here:

Nodes with the greatest FanOuts (i.e. the botmaster)
